## keyboard shortcuts
  Shortcuts I frequently use:
- alt + tab (switch tabs)
- ctrl + alt + delete (close hanged programs)
- shift + ctrl + arrow key (select words)

  Shortcuts I would like to use often:
- ctrl + t (open a new tab)
- ctrl + w (close the current tab)
- shift + tab (switch tabs)
